--------------------
What BabelObjects Is
--------------------

BabelObjects is a template engine that separates presentation from logic.

BabelObjects provides a framework to write components you can reuse in
different context (web, text, ...). These components can then be used through
DreamWeaver with extensions, without programming skills.

Thanks to the framework, you will be able to call components in different
languages through SOAP, .NET, ... to avoid to create the wheel again.
