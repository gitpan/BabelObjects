Configuration
-------------

  1. Copy the conf directory in the place you want to put configuration files.
     /usr/local/babelobjects/conf is a good choice.

  2. Update the configuration file bo.xml according your installation. In a 
     first time, just update webRoot, confDir and webDir to suit your system.

  3. Copy cgi programs in your cgi directory :
       root# cp ./lib/Controller.* <your cgi-bin directory>

  4. Update the $CFG_DIR variable in Controller.cgi or Controller.fcgi
     according the directory where you put your configuration files.

  5. The web server must be configured to intercept bo pages
     (*.bo, *.htm, *.html, ...) and redirect them on the runner. 
     Add the following lines in your httpd.conf: 

       LoadModule fastcgi_module     libexec/mod_fastcgi.so
       AddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi
       AddHandler bo-runner .bo  # You can add a handler for .html if you want

       #Don't setup the fcgi version in the first time.
       #Prefer the cgi version to test the system.

       Action bo-runner /cgi-bin/Controller.cgi

       # When everything is OK, try the FastCGI version

       #Action bo-runner /cgi-bin/Controller.fcgi
       #FastCgiServer /<your cgi-bin directory>/Controller.fcgi -processes 2

-----
Start

----

To test the installation, copy sample/test.bo in your html space.
Go and visit it.

Enjoy !
